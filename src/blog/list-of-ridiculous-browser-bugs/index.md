I am starting a list of common and ridiculous bugs that I‚Äôve found in different browsers along with quick fixes if I know of them. It will most likely grow over time as I find and remember more idiotic bugs.

## IE 8

* `console.log()` causes JS errors

## IE 10 & 11 (and maybe 9)

* I think CSS `calc()` works, but it doesn't seem to work if you do something like `transform: translateY(calc(100% - 50px));` which works in other browsers

## Android 2 Stock Browser

*(2.3.4 anyway, but really who even uses Android 2 anymore?)*

* Can‚Äôt use CSS transforms on pseudo elements (`::before` and `::after`)
* Fixed positioning works like crap
* `overflow: scroll` doesn‚Äôt work

## Mobile Safari

* Don‚Äôt even think about transitioning `visibility` on something that you're hiding and showing with `opacity: 0; visibility: hidden;` because if you do, it will always remain hidden‚Ä¶

## Desktop Safari

* Maybe it‚Äôs just me, but I feel like Safari 8 is just a huge pile of junk. Seriously, like 50 times a day it refuses to load a page and says the server cannot be found only to load it correctly if I refresh.

## Chrome

* Tables apparently ignore `max-width`. I‚Äôm not sure if this is actually a bug, though, because it sounds like maybe Chrome does what the CSS spec says it should. Either way, it‚Äôs annoying and dumb.
* I‚Äôve also noticed a lot of jankiness if you try to use fixed backgrounds in Chrome, especially if you‚Äôre on a retina Mac.
