I was geeking out about No Manâ€™s Sky so much before it came out that I decided to make a digital log to keep track of what I encounter in the game. Itâ€™s got this real neat glitchy text effect on it.

Iâ€™ll probably post a more detailed description of some of the effects that I made on the site later on. For now, I just wanted to post a link to it. It can be found at http://nms.alp.onl.
