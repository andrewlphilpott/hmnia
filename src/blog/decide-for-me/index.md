Itâ€™s been a good six or seven months and I totally forgot to write about this, but I made a super simple little web app called [Decide For Me](http://de.cidefor.me). Basically, itâ€™s a pro/con list which allows you to give each item on the list a weight. It will then add up the weights of your pros and your cons and tell you whether or not you should do what youâ€™re trying to decide. I recently used the app to help decide whether or not my wife and I should purchase a new home (which we did).

I had a lot of fun building this little app. It uses HTML5 Local Storage so that you can create a list and reference it later (as long as you donâ€™t do something silly like clear your cache). If you save it to your home screen on iOS, you donâ€™t need to worry about clearing your cache because it will still keep all of your data stored. Iâ€™m also using GitHub Pages to host the app, which I had no idea was even a thing until it came to the point of figuring out where to host it. Itâ€™s a pretty awesome and easy thing to use. I donâ€™t remember all the details, but basically I just had to buy a domain â€” I bought cidefor.me and added a subdomain of â€˜deâ€™. Get it? â€” and push my repo to GitHub and then do some other easy stuff to get the domain pointing to the repo. You should definitely [check it out](https://pages.github.com).
