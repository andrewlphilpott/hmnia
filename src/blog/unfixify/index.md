Letâ€™s face it: fixed headers and footers are really annoying. And us web designers, weâ€™re abusing the crap out of them. So, without further adieu, let me introduce Unfixifyâ„¢Â®Â©.

Unfixify is a neat little bookmarklet that looks for elements with `position: fixed;` and converts that to `position: absolute;`. It will almost certainly break some styles somewhere and make a page look silly, but at least there wonâ€™t be any fixed elements anymore.

I created Unfixify this morning while shopping online. I got super sick of having like 200px of my viewport taken up by navigation. Honestly, I think sticking navigation to the top of the viewport is kind of insulting. I mean, how lazy do you think I am? Like I can't just hit cmd+up to reach the navigation?

If you want to use Unfixify (which you obviously do), all you have to do is drag this here link <a title="Seriously, you should do this." href="javascript:(function()%7B%09document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='http://himynameisandrew.com/unfixify/unfixify.js';%7D)();">Unfixify</a> into your bookmarks bar or whatever. (I didnâ€™t bother confirming thatâ€™s how it works in Chrome and stuff, so if it doesnâ€™t work that way, Iâ€™m sure you can figure it out.) Oh and then you've got to click the thing when you want to use it.

## Check out this totally realistic testimonial:

> I was using the internet one time and there was this website and it had this navigatory element and it wouldnâ€™t go away and it made me really frustrated and I said a swear word. Then I found out about Unfixify and I have never said a bad word since then.
