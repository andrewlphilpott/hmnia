I have noticed on a couple of recent projects that I‚Äôve built, that Symbolset‚Äôs keyword replacement doesn‚Äôt work as expected on Android devices (specifically, Android version 4.3, but it may affect other versions as well). I don‚Äôt think I ever came across any documented fixes for this issue, which I assume is because Symbolset‚Äôs website says that keyword replacement works on Android.

Hopefully this post will be helpful to others in my situation, but in all honesty, I‚Äôm writing this mainly for myself because I always forget how I‚Äôve worked around the problem in the past. So here is the fix that I‚Äôve found:

## Text Rendering

Symbolset has `text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;` in the default CSS files, which seems to be part of the issue. The first step is to override this style for Android. You can do it however you want, but I typically just add a UA sniffing line in my JavaScript and add the class ‚Äúandroid‚Äù to the html element of the page. Then, I simply add the following code (change out the classes to match whichever Symbolset fonts you‚Äôre using):

<pre><code>.android .ss-standard,
.android .ss-social,
.android [class*="ss-"]:before,
.android [class*="ss-"].right:after {
	text-rendering: auto;
}</code></pre>

## Modify the Symbolset JavaScript

The next (and final) step is to modify each individual Symbolset font‚Äôs corresponding JavaScript file. This is a pretty simple process, because all you need to do is change one character. The first line of the file is a conditional that checks the browser‚Äôs user agent. Simply change `Android [1-2]` to `Android [1-4]` to include Android version 4. You‚Äôll obviously have to include the JavaScript file on your page, but I assume you‚Äôre already doing that for legacy browser support.
