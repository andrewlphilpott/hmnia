My name is Andrew Philpott. I live in Grand Rapids, Michigan with my [awesome wife](http://twitter.com/emilykoffman) and a little pomeranian named Chanel.

Iâ€™m a front end engineer at [CM Group](http://cmgroup.com/), where I build neat apps with some pretty awesome people.

If you want to know anything else about me, I can be found on
