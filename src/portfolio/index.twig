            <p>5x5 Night started a few years back as a simple project: allow users to submit and vote on ideas. At the end of the voting period, five ideas would be chosen to present their idea in hopes of receiving up to $5,000 in funding. 5x5 Night was eventually shut down to make way for Start Garden. In the beginning of 2015, though, 5x5 was resurrected and I had the opportunity to rebuild it from the ground up with a brand new design.</p>

            <p>Sometimes I have a hard time making decisions. To try to help, I made a little app called Decide For Me. Itâ€™s basically a pro/con list with weighted items that calculates the total weight and tells you what to do. I had a lot of fun making this side-project and used some technologies (like Local Storage) that I didnâ€™t have a ton of previous experience with.</p>

            <p>Herman Miller Healthcareâ€™s child company, Nemschoff, came to Mighty seeking an entirely new website from design through CMS development. I had the chance to build both the static front end templates and the ExpressionEngine-powered CMS. A major emphasis of the project was to provide Nemschoff with an easy way for them to organize their massive amount of content. From product data and design resources to videos and case studies, we delivered a CMS that not only suits their needs but is easy to use.</p>

Together with ArtPrizeâ€™s technology team and designers and developers at Mighty, we were able to design and build the front end and CMS for a huge application that gets a massive amount of use each year. The ArtPrize website also holds the distinction of being the first large fully-responsive that I (and Mighty) built.</p>

Riding on the success of ReindeerCam.com, he wanted to create something that appealed to the audience that had formed around that project. I was able to provide design, front end, and CMS development for this interactive, responsive website.</p>
