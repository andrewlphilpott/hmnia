    <p>This post is from a previous version of my website, and may not be completely accurate to the design anymore.</p>
</aside>

<p>I recently finished a major redesign of my site. I had a lot of fun designing and building this new version and got a chance to experiment a ton with new things.</p>
<h2 id="goodbye-images">Goodbye, Images</h2>
<p>One thing that I&#39;m thrilled about is the very small number of images that are used in the design. Instead, almost everything (aside from a couple of backgrounds and some icons) is made using CSS3. This has a couple of benefits, one being that there are less images to load. Secondly, I don&#39;t have to worry about how my images look on hi-res devices like my iPhone 4.</p>
<h2 id="-media">@media</h2>
<p>Speaking of iPhones, my site is now using <code>@media</code> queries to change the layout based on the size of your browser window. I first heard <a href="http://unstoppablerobotninja.com">Ethan Marcotte</a> talk about using media queries to create a &quot;responsive&quot; website that adjusts its design to suit any sized screen.</p>
<p>They&#39;re actually <em>really</em> easy to use. Say, for example, I wanted my site to have a black background if the viewport was less than 500 pixels. All I would have to do is enter this code into the CSS:</p>
<pre><code>@media screen and (max-width: 499px) {
    body {
        background-color: #000;
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>It&#39;s that easy. Before, I had considered creating a completely different stylesheet for mobile browsers. I have to say, though, using <code>@media</code> is <em>a lot</em> easier. It also works for desktop-based browsers, which is awesome.</p>
<h2 id="refocused">Refocused</h2>
<p>On top of some of the new visual changes to the site, I&#39;ve also shifted the design so that the focus is more on my blog. I stripped away a lot of the more social-related things (like links in the footer) and gave the site a more consistent feel throughout to make it feel more like a blog.</p>
<p>Also, on top of traditional commenting, I&#39;ve added another way for visitors to provide feedback more quickly. I added little heart buttons to each post which you can click to let me know you like a post. I have to admit, these were inspired by Facebook&#39;s like buttons.</p>
<h2 id="check-it-out">Check it out</h2>
<p>Go ahead and check out the rest of the site. I&#39;m very happy with the way it turned out. Any feedback is always welcome.</p>
