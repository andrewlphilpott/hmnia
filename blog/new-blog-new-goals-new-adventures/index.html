<p>It has been too long since I blogged. A lot has happened in the past few months. I redesigned my blog, we had a great ‚Äú2013 Goals‚Äù meeting at Mighty, and my wife and I even had the chance to go to England for a week so that I could go to New Adventures.</p>
<h2 id="new-blog">New Blog</h2>
<p>It‚Äôs been in the works for a while, and I have finally finished redesigning and building my blog. Since the last version of my blog, my design and development process has changed a lot. The last version of my blog was my first attempt at responsive design, and it really shows when you look at the code. Since then, I‚Äôve learned a lot about RWD. One of the main changes is that I have moved to a mobile first approach which has been great.</p>
<p>The thing that I‚Äôm most excited about is the fact that my site is now running on <a href="http://statamic.com">Statamic</a> rather than ExpressionEngine. So far, Statamic has been really easy to use and it‚Äôs great to have my site running without a database.</p>
<h2 id="new-goals">New Goals</h2>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, we had a 2013 Goals meeting at the beginning of the year at <a href="http://mightyinthemidwest.com">Mighty</a>. The idea was that everybody had to come up with 3 personal goals, 3 professional goals, and 3 goals for the company.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve never made a resolution before, but taking some time to think of things in my life that I could improve was a nice exercise. One of my personal goals was to finish redesigning my blog (check) and to start blogging more regularly. I‚Äôm going to try to start blogging at least once a month, which is a huge increase from what I used to do.</p>
<h2 id="new-adventures">New Adventures</h2>
<p>Probably the most exciting part of the new year was my trip to England to go to <a href="http://naconf.com">New Adventures</a>. Before the trip I had never been overseas, so it was a big change.</p>
<p>My wife and I spent a few days in London before the conference which was in Nottingham. It was great to explore such a huge city, and we both had a really good time. We even got to spend some time at Abbey Road with <a href="http://poss.cc">Andrew Possehl</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully I‚Äôll get a chance to write some more about my time in England and post some pictures, but for now I‚Äôll just say that England and New Adventures were both awesome.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve got some <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/575400/notes/naconf/index.html">notes from the conference available here</a>. I didn‚Äôt get a chance to take notes on all of the talks, but the entire conference was full of great information and inspiration.</p>
