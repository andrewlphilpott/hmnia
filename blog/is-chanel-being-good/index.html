    <p>This post is quite old and the app referenced is no longer live.</p>
</aside>

<p>About three weeks ago, my fiancÃ©e (Emily) and I bought a puppy and named it Chanel. Sheâ€™s probably the cutest dog that has ever lived, but she is also a huge pain. She poops everywhere, chews everything, and barks constantly.</p>

<p>Lucky for me (Iâ€™m being totally sarcastic), Emily is going to be living in Flint for a couple months this summer which means that I get to take care of Chanel on my own. I decided to make an iPhone app called Is Chanel Being Good? so that I can let Emily see what sheâ€™s missing out on while sheâ€™s gone.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s a pretty simple app. You launch it and it loads the current status and styles the page differently depending on if Chanel is being good or bad. Then it shows a little sentence explaining what sheâ€™s been doing.</p>
<p>I highly doubt anybody will ever use my app other than Emily. It was really fun to make, though, and it only took me a few hours. If you have an iPhone and you do want to download it, though, you wonâ€™t find it in the App Store. Instead, just visit the page in Safari on your phone and save it to your home screen.</p>
