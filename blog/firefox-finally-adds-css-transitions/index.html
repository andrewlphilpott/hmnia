<p>This is just a short note to say that it looks like Firefox will finally be supporting CSS transitions in their next release. I downloaded the beta release of Firefox 4 the other day and was very happy to see that my <code>-moz-transition</code> styles were working. The implementation leaves something to be desired, though. I&#39;ve noticed that a lot of the transitions that are super smooth in Webkit are pretty sketchy in Firefox. Hopefully this is something that will be worked out before the official release.</p>
<h2 id="my-only-complaint">My only complaint</h2>
<p>One other thing I was disappointed with was Firefox&#39;s rendering of <code>border-radius</code> which <em>still</em> can&#39;t be applied directly to images. (Well, it can, but it won&#39;t do anything). Mozilla has been supporting border radius for a long, long time and they still haven&#39;t fixed this issue which I find extremely irritating. Maybe they think that&#39;s not the way that <code>border-radius</code> should work; if they do, they are <em>completely</em> wrong.</p>
<p>Border-radius should definitely be a style that can be applied to images, especially when you consider content management systems built for clients who don&#39;t have the knowledge or ability to apply rounded corners to an image on their own. So get with the program, Firefox! I&#39;m tired of using jQuery to create workarounds for rounded corners on images. I wouldn&#39;t even bother if it were only IE that didn&#39;t behave, but since Firefox still doesn&#39;t have its act together, that causes issues.</p>
