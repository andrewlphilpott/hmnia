    <p>This post is very old and the sandbox site referenced is no longer around.</aside>
</aside>

<p>This weekend I really wanted to design a quick site and try out some new CSS techniques I&#39;ve been learning, so I made a sandbox site. What&#39;s a sandbox? Basically it&#39;s a place where I&#39;ll post my experiments and little projects that I&#39;ve been playing around with.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-design">Experimental Design</h2>
<p>Since the site itself is a home for experiments, I figured the design should reflect that spirit of exploration. I made the site using a lot of CSS3 transitions (sorry, Safari and Chrome haters, they only work with webkit so far).</p>
<p>Also, I used a cool new technique to make a letterpress effect on the main headline and some of the other text on the site. It&#39;s done using two different text shadows, one of which extends above the text and is darker. The other one extends below the text and is a lighter color. IE users, you&#39;re out of luck (maybe certain browser makers should get on the ball and start adding CSS3 properties).</p>
<h2 id="social-experiment">Social Experiment</h2>
<p>I even added a little social experiment to the site. The headline of the landing page says &quot;andrew philpott&#39;s sandbox is&quot; in ginormous text. Next to the headline there&#39;s a little input field that says &quot;Have your say...&quot; which you can enter text in and then submit. Whatever you submit will be added after the headline and to the title of the site.</p>
<p>I though this would be a fun way to see what people think of the things I&#39;m working on. So far some of the comments have included &quot;rad&quot;, &quot;full of cool&quot; and &quot;dope.&quot; There were also a couple of other comments that said things like &quot;hello&quot; because I was stupid and labeled the input field as &quot;Say hello...&quot; at first.</p>
<p>You can view all of the comments by clicking the little + link next to the last comment.</p>
<h2 id="spam-experiment">Spam Experiment</h2>
<p>I also threw in a little test spam catcher, so we&#39;ll see if that actually works. Any person (or spambot) who triggers the spam catcher will get redirected to <a href="http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/0/02/DONOTWANT_doggy2.jpg">this picture</a> and the comment won&#39;t be submitted.</p>
<p>Oh, one last thing: I like the Konami Code.</p>
