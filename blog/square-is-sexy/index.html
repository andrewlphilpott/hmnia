<p>I recently saw some <a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/windows-phone-7-series-interface/#2710476">pictures of the new Windows Phone 7 series interface</a> on <a href="http://www.engadget.com">Engadget</a>. Now, I&#39;m not a big fan of Microsoft (in fact I hate them), but I have to say that the new interface is really nice. It&#39;s simple and clean and uses nice, flat colored blocks with square corners.</p>
<p>It seems like rounded corners are everywhere these days; they&#39;re quickly becoming one of the main ingredients of a lot of sites. I suspect that CSS3&#39;s new border-radius property has something to do with it, but whatever the cause, I think we&#39;re starting to go a little overboard. It&#39;s starting to feel like a fad on the same level as overdone gradients and drop shadows.</p>
<p>Square can be sexy too. In fact, I think that a site with all square corners and a nice color scheme can often be a lot better looking than a site that has rounded corners. And I think that a design with square corners <em>always</em> looks better than a design where every single element has round corners thrown on it.</p>
<h2 id="get-square-get-sexy">Get Square, Get Sexy</h2>
<p>I think as an industry, we really need to stop following fads. The whole Web 2.0 craze finally seems like it&#39;s starting to die down, but there are new trends that are beginning to pop up. Just because it&#39;s easier than ever to create rounded corners doesn&#39;t mean that we need to put them on everything we design.</p>
