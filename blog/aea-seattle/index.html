<p>Last week I had the opportunity to attend <a href="http://aneventapart.com/2010/seattle/">An Event Apart Seattle</a>. The conference itself was two days long, followed by a one day workshop on HTML5 and CSS3. I got to hear from experts like <a href="http://zeldman.com/">Jeffrey Zeldman</a>, <a href="http://simplebits.com/">Dan Cederholm</a>, <a href="http://adactio.com/">Jeremy Keith</a>, <a href="http://malarkey.co.uk/">Andy Clarke</a> and a lot more.</p>
<p>This was only my second web conference (the first one being <a href="http://sxsw.com/">SXSW 2010</a>) and it was an awesome learning experience. While SXSW seemed like a social gathering first and a place to learn second, AEA was all about inspirational talks packed with information. I took a huge amount of notes that I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll come back to from time to time. I also got a chance to eat lunch and chat with Andy Clarke on the first day, which was really cool.</p>
<p>On the first day of the conference, I decided I&#39;d take my notes in HTML (HTML5 no less) format. I figured it would be easier for me to understand them if I marked them up since I tend to dislike using Pages or Word. Not only did this decision make my note taking process a lot easier for me, it also gave me a chance to style my notes and use some of the CSS3 techniques that I&#39;ve been experimenting with for a while and that people like Dan Cederholm were talking about at the conference. You can <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/575400/notes/aea-seattle/index.html">find my notes from the conference here</a>.</p>
