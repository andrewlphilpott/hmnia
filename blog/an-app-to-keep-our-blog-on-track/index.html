<strong class="note_hdg">Note</strong>

<p>This was originally posted on the <a href="http://blog.elevatorup.com/post/143790219652/an-app-to-keep-our-blog-on-track">Elevator Up blog</a>.</p>
</aside>

<p>At Elevator Up, we take blogging seriously. We‚Äôve got a spreadsheet of due dates for everybody and each team member is expected to turn in their posts on time or face <a href="http://d.pr/i/TJ4H">dire consequences</a>. (Just kidding, but we seriously like it when people write their posts on schedule.)</p>
<p>The problem with our spreadsheet is that someone has to manually update the data every time a team member writes a new blog post and then everybody has to go find the file in Dropbox to see when they‚Äôre due ‚Äì until now, that is. I recently worked with Tori to figure out how we could make this better and ended up putting together a simple blog schedule app which is readily viewable for all team members and can be easily updated.</p>
<h2 id="building-the-app">Building the App</h2>
<p>I used this as an opportunity to test out <a href="http://firebase.com">Firebase</a>, which I had been wanting to try for quite a while. Firebase provides you with a database and a JavaScript SDK for reading from and writing to that database. It also provides ways to implement things like authentication and customizable security rules. This sounded perfect to me because I wanted to build something quickly without having to mess with any back end development.</p>
<p>It worked out great. I was able to very quickly set up some simple data which is, in essence, just some JSON with records for each blog author and some relevant data. Here&#39;s what an author looks like in Firebase:</p>
<pre><code>author {
  fname: &#39;Chim&#39;,
  lname: &#39;Richalds&#39;,
  registered: 1432785600000,
  last: 1459828800000,
  days: 35,
  remaining: 0
}</code></pre><p>Broken down, what we&#39;re looking at is an author record which has a first name, a last name, a registration date (stored as a Unix timestamp), the date of their last blog post (also a Unix timestamp), the number of days in their blog cycle, and the number of days they had remaining the last time they submitted a post.</p>
<p>On the front end, we pull in all of that data, check the <em>last</em> value and the <em>days</em> value, get the current date, and then do some math to figure out how many days they have left. We also add to their <em>days</em> if they had any remaining days the last time they submitted a post.</p>
<p>That last part is important. We want authors to be able to submit posts whenever they are ready and build up a silo of extra time if they want. So if an author had 30 days left before their next post was due and they decided to submit a post early, they would get 30 added to their next cycle. It works the other way, too. If an author was 5 days overdue when they made a submission, they would have 5 days removed from their next cycle.</p>
<h2 id="designing-the-app">Designing the App</h2>
<p>It‚Äôs weird to talk about the design after the development, right? Well, I‚Äôm not a designer. With that said, I do enjoy designing things and I had a lot of fun designing this app. I took a different approach than I think most would. In the initial planning stage, I threw together a quick wireframe and showed it to Tori. After confirming that we were on the same page, I jumped into development and designed the app in-browser while developing.</p>
<p>Like I said, I&#39;m not a designer. Even so, I‚Äôm pretty happy with the way things turned out. I think it achieves the goal of being easy to quickly look at and see who has posts coming up and who is past due.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/blog/schedule.png" alt="A screenshot of the blog schedule"></p>
<p>Updating submission dates is simple, too. As long as you‚Äôre logged in, you can just click on a team member, pick a date from the calendar, and submit it.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/blog/datepicker.png" alt="A screenshot of the date picker"></p>
<p>The nice thing about designing while developing was that it allowed me to actually see how things worked and felt in a browser as opposed to looking at static mockups and imagining how things would feel. It also gave me a chance to play around with animations like <a href="http://codepen.io/andrewlphilpott/details/pydExN/">this loading graphic</a> in real-time.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>I really enjoyed having this opportunity to try out a new technology and to tackle some design. I would definitely recommend Firebase to anybody looking for an easy-to-use back end platform. I know I‚Äôll use it again. If you‚Äôve got anything you have built with it, we‚Äôd love to hear about it!</p>
