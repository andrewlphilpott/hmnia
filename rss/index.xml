				<title>No Man’s Sky Log</title>
				<description>I was geeking out about No Man’s Sky so much before it came out that I decided to make a digital log to keep track of what I encounter in the game. It’s got this real neat glitchy text effect on it.</description>

				<title>In Defense of Classes</title>
				<description>A few months ago, Tim Baxter wrote a post for A List Apart titled _Meaningful CSS: Style Like You Mean It_. In it, he lays out an argument for avoiding the use of classes in markup and instead favoring things like attributes which make your markup more meaningful and elements as CSS selectors.

				<title>Using CSS Masks to Create “Transparent” JPGs</title>
				<description>JPG images are great. They allow us to show photos on the web while keeping the file size relatively small (compared to a photo saved as a PNG, anyway). But what do you do when you need a photo with transparency and you don’t want to sacrifice file size? Enter CSS masks.</description>
