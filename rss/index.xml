				<title>My Transition from iOS to Android</title>
				<description>I’ve been an iOS fan for a long time. I was a poor college student when the original iPhone came out, and that was still the case with the 3G and 3GS, but after that I had an iPhone 4, 5, and 6. Despite all of this, I recently started feeling like I wanted to try something different.</description>

				<title>In Defense of Classes</title>
				<description>A few months ago, Tim Baxter wrote a post for A List Apart titled _Meaningful CSS: Style Like You Mean It_. In it, he lays out an argument for avoiding the use of classes in markup and instead favoring things like attributes which make your markup more meaningful and elements as CSS selectors. There are parts of his idea that I like, but overall I don’t think it’s all that practical for many projects other than very small websites or apps.</description>
